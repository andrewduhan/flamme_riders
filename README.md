You'll need to install two fonts, if you don't already have them:  
* Verve Std (Heavy and Medium)
* Avenir (Medium)

Point your browser at index.html and it should just work. You can make manual edits to the text and Apply them as needed. 

The image is drawn in SVG but displayed as a 300dpi PNG for easy download/print. "US Game Deck" size, 2.2"x3.43" (56Ã—87mm)

I made a bunch and had them printed front and back.  Players can draw two cards and then choose either side for each of their riders.
The bottom of the card has a table to record the riders' wins & losses over time.
