Create random rider cards for your games of Flamme Rouge!
Point your browser at index.html and it should just work.  The image is drawn in SVG but displayed as a 300dpi PNG for easy download/print. "US Game Deck" size, 2.2"x3.43" (56Ã—87mm)

I made a bunch and had them printed front and back.  Players can draw two cards and then choose either side for each of their riders.
The bottom of the card has a table to record the riders' wins & losses over time.
